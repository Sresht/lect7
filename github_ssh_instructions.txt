Follow these steps to set up an SSH Key. Along with many other benefits,
the SSH key will allow you to push to github without entering your
Github username and password every time!

1. Go to https://www.github.com/settings/keys
2. Click on new SSH key, don't type anything.
3. Run cd ~; ssh-keygen -t rsa (enter three times, no passphrase, no file path needed)
4. Now run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of id_rsa.pub into your new SSH key
6. Make a personal remote directory called lect7 by going to https://www.github.com/new
7. Make a new local repo: 
    cd ~/environment/; mkdir lect7; cd lect7; git init
8. Now add the remote URL:
    git remote add origin http://www.github.com/[your_username]/lect7
    git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/[your_username]/lect7.git
    
    
    
To test that this works, add a README file:
9. touch README && echo "test" >> README
10. git add README && git commit -m "Add README file"
11. Push your commit by running: git push origin master
    When asked if you want to continue, type "yes" and press enter.
12. You should be able to push to Github now without typing your username/password in!
